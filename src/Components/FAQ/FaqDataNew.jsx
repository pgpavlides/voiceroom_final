    question: "Why do I need a coach?",

A coach can hold you accountable and encourage you to celebrate the achievement of goals, help you deal with vocal issues, and fill the missing pieces in your vocal knowledge. Essentially, the right voice coach will help you shine bright without burning out your voice.",
